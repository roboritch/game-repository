## Project Overview

This is the most robust unity project I have worked on so far. It was a group project for COSC 310 focusing on advanced design patterns and the agile workflow. I was the ‘product owner’ of a group of four (including me). The game itself is a mix between a real time and turn based strategy on a 2D grid. Only one unit can move at a time but the player can assign moves at any time (as long as the unit is not in cooldown). Each unit grow as it moves, its size is the same as its health. 

## Installation

The project is updated to Unity 5.5.1f1 and can be run from that version. 

## Implementation

I high level of abstraction was used to create units and actions, though much of the lower level abstractions in the code can be considered tightly coupled. The game supports basic lan networking and is capable of creating and saving new maps. 

## Project Problems

This one the first game I had worked on in a team and overall it went quite well. As this was my first foray into Git there were several merge errors resulting in rebasing the project, as the project entered its second half our understanding of version control and how to do it effectively was increased. The scope of the project was too large considering our inexperience with agile development. Many of the features listed in the initial pitch were not included or were unfinished.
